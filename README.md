# Tenzies Game

Roll the dice until all die have the same number. Click on a die to freeze it at a number you want to match other dice with. You keep freezing dice until all the numbers match then you win the game(Ten 6's for example). If you decide to match a number different from your currently matched number, simply click on that die to un-freeze it and start to match a new number. 

The technologies used are: React, CSS and [more](https://github.com/AtGbemiga/tenzies-game/blob/main/package.json)
